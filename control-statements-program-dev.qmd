# Control statements and program development 
 
## Objectives

In this module, you’ll learn:

- Decide whether to execute actions with conditional statements `if`, `if ... else` and `if -> elif -> else`
              
- Execute statements repeatedly with `for` and `while`.
              
- Shorten assignment expressions with augmented assignments.
              
- Use the `for` statement and the built-in `range` function to repeat actions for a sequence of values.
              
- Perform sentinel-controlled repetition with `while`.
              
- Learn problem-solving skills: understanding problem requirements, dividing problems into smaller pieces, developing algorithms to solve problems and implementing those algorithms in code.
              
- Develop algorithms through the process of top-down, step-by-step refinement.
              
- Create compound conditions with the Boolean operators `and`, `or` and `not` .
              
- Stop looping with `break` statements.
              
- Force the next iteration of a loop with `continue` .
              
- Use some functional-style programming features to write scripts that are more concise, clearer, easier to debug and easier to parallelize

## Control statements
- Computer programs execute sequentially
- Control statements are able to alter the sequence of executions

## Selection statements
- ***if***
- ***if else***
- ***if elif else***

## Conditional Expressions

### Expressions evaluate to either True or False
- Non-zero numbers evaluate to `True`
- Non-empty strings evaluate to `True`

```{pyodide}
x = 12
# x = 0 # uncomment this to observe the only value that leads to the condition being False

if x:
  print('Condition is True')
else:
  print('Condition is False')
```

```{pyodide}
x = '' # this example to observe the only value that leads to the condition being False

if x:
  print('Condition is True')
else:
  print('Condition is False')
```

### Suite indentation
- The block under each condition is termed a suite
- Python relies on proper indentation for its syntax

```{pyodide}
x = 36
if (x%2) == 0:
  print('x is an even number \n')
  print('x is divisible by 2 \n')
  
print('x has no remainder when divided into two parts \n')
```

### Conditional expressions may be written in one line of code
```{pyodide}
x = 36
y = ('even' if (x%2)==0 else 'odd')
print(f'y is {y}')
```

## Loops with the ```while``` statement
* The ```while``` command allows a block of code to be executed a variable number of times

### Determine when a Netflix subscription will exceed $20
* Let's assume that Netflix will raise the price by 5% after every year

```{pyodide}
rate_of_increase = 0.05
price_of_netflix = 18.99
year = 2025

while price_of_netflix < 20:
    print('A Netflix subscription costs', price_of_netflix, 'in', year )
    year = year + 1
    price_of_netflix = price_of_netflix * (1 + rate_of_increase)
```
### Formatting strings to make numbers more readable

* Note the leading ```f```, the ```{}```, and the string formatting character ```0.2f``` and ```0d``` in the above

```{pyodide}
rate_of_increase = 0.05
price_of_netflix = 14.99
year = 2022

# The loop should continue until the condition is valid, once the price is over $20, the loop will break ...
while price_of_netflix < 20:
    print(f'A Netflix subscription costs {price_of_netflix:0.2f} in {year:0d}')
    year = year + 1
    price_of_netflix = price_of_netflix * (1 + rate_of_increase)
```

## The ```for``` loop
* The most common type of iteration in Python
* The ```for``` statement allows an action to be executed a _fixed_ number of times
* NB: Python indexes from 0 (not 1)
* The built-in ```range(x)``` function outputs all integers from ```0``` to ```x-1```

```{pyodide}
for i in range(10): # Note the argument of the function 
    print(i)
print('End of the first for-loop \n')


my_first_list = [-3, 2, -5, 4, 0]
print(f"My list is {my_first_list} which is of data type: {type(my_first_list)}")

for item in my_first_list:
    print(item)
```

## Iterables and lists
* The sequence to the right of the ```for``` keyword must be an _iterable_
* The most common type of iterable in Python is a _list_:

```{pyodide}
groceries = ['apples', 'bananas', 'milk', 'chicken', 'cheese'] # creates a list that a for loop can iterate over

print(f"I have {len(groceries)} items in my grocery list.\n") # counts the number of items in the list
for item in groceries:
    print(f"- {item}")
```

## Augmented expressions
* Adding and multiplying a set of numbers is a very common operation
* The operators ```+=``` and ```*=``` facilitate iterative sums and products

```{pyodide}
running_sum = 0
for i in [1,2,3,4,5]:
    # increments the sum after the initial 0
    running_sum += i
    
print(running_sum)
```

```{pyodide}
running_product = 1
for i in [1,2,3,4,5]:
    running_product *= i
    
print(running_product)
```

## The ```break``` and ```continue``` statements
* Python exits a ```while``` or ```for``` loop if it encounters a ```break``` statement
* Python moves to the next iteration of the loop if it encounters a ```continue``` statement

Example of the `break` statement:
```python
running_sum = 0
for i in range(1000000):
    num = int(input('Enter a number to add. Enter -1 to stop'))
    if num!=-1:
        running_sum += num
    else:
        break

print('The sum of the entered numbers is', running_sum)
```

Example of the `continue` statement. The following program will only add _positive_ numbers:

```python
running_sum = 0
for i in range(1000000):
    num = int(input('Enter a number to add. Enter 0 to stop'))
    if num<0:
        continue
    elif num==0:
        break
    else:
        running_sum += num

print(f'The sum of the positive entered numbers is: {running_sum}')
```

## Logical operators
Logical operators are used on conditional statements (either True or False). They perform Logical AND, Logical OR, and Logical NOT operations.

| Operator | Description                                      | Example                        |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `AND`    | Returns `True` if **both** statements are true   | `x < 5 and x < 10`             |
| `OR`     | Returns `True` if **one** of the statements is true | `x < 5 or x < 4`            |
| `NOT`    | Reverses the result; `False` if condition is true | `not(x < 5 and x < 10)`     |
 
### Example of `AND` Operator
The Logical ***AND*** operator returns True if both the operands are True else it returns False.
```{pyodide}
a = 10
b = 10
c = -10

if a > 0 and b > 0:
    print("The numbers are greater than 0")
if a > 0 and b > 0 and c > 0:
    print("The numbers are greater than 0")
else:
    print("Atleast one number is not greater than 0")
```
Example 2: The code checks if all variables a, b, and c evaluate to True, printing a message accordingly.

```{pyodide}
# Atleast one number has boolean value as False

a = 10
b = 12
c = 0

if a and b and c:
    print("All the numbers have boolean value as True")
    
else:
    print("Atleast one number has boolean value as False")
```
> **Note**: If the first expression is evaluated to be false while using the AND operator, then the further expressions are not evaluated.

### Example of `OR` operator
The Logical ***OR*** operator returns True if either of the operands is True.

```{pyodide}
a = 10
b = -10
c = 0

if a > 0 or b > 0:
    print("Either of the number is greater than 0")
    
else:
    print("No number is greater than 0")
    
if b > 0 or c > 0:
    print("Either of the number is greater than 0")
    
else:
    print("No number is greater than 0")
```
The code checks if any of the variables a, b, or c has a boolean value as True; if so, it prints "At least one number has boolean value as True", otherwise, it prints "All the numbers have boolean value as False".

```{pyodide}
# Atleast one number has boolean value as True

a = 10
b = 12
c = 0
if a or b or c:
    print("Atleast one number has boolean value as True")
else:
    print("All the numbers have boolean value as False")
```
### Example of `NOT` operator
The Logical ***NOT*** operator works with a single boolean value. If the boolean value is True it returns False and vice-versa.

```{pyodide}
a = 10

if not a:
    print("Boolean value of a is True")
    
if not (a % 3 == 0 or a % 5 == 0):
    print("10 is not divisible by either 3 or 5")
    
else:
    print("10 is divisible by either 3 or 5")
```

## Algorithm development

Algorithms often have three stages:

1. _Initialization of variables_
2. _Processing or logical implementation_
3. _termination_

* A _Requirements_ statement specifies the objective of the program
* Example: _The nth term in the Fibonacci sequence is defined by adding the previous two terms. Determine the nth term in the sequence for arbitrary n_
* _Algorithm_
    * Set ```F(0):=0```
    * Set ```F(1):=1```
    * Repeat from 2 to n:
        * ```F(n) := F(n-1) + F(n-2)```
    * Return ```F(n)``

### What is the Fibonacci Sequence?

The Fibonacci sequence is a fun way to keep practicing Python. The Fibonacci sequence starts with `0` and `1`, with each number being the sum of the two before it. The simplest way to generate it in Python is with a loop:

```{pyodide}
# Initialization of variables
n = 10  
a, b = 0, 1  

# for loop implementation, this will print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers:
for _ in range(n):  
    print(a, end=" ")  
    a, b = b, a + b  
```
The Fibonacci sequence is a mathematical concept that appears in many areas of science and nature. It is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting with 0 and 1. This pattern forms the basis for applications in fields like computer science and finance. 

Two main aspects define the Fibonacci sequence: the recursive structure of the sequence and its relationship with the golden ratio.

Recall that the Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1. Each new number is the sum of the two numbers before it. 

For example:

`0 + 1 = 1`

`1 + 1 = 2`

`1 + 2 = 3`

`2 + 3 = 5`

`3 + 5 = 8`

`5 + 8 = 13` ...

Mathematically, we write it as `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)`. The sequence builds itself by repeatedly adding the last two numbers. The first two numbers, 0 and 1, are the starting point or base cases. Without these, the sequence wouldn’t work.

### Algorithm _refinement_
* When designing algorithms, it is good practice to sketch out the steps in several stages
* The level of detail increases as you move to the next stage

```{pyodide}
# Initialization
second_last = 0  # F_0
last = 1         # F_1

# Input
n = int(input("Please enter the index (n) of the desired term in the Fibonacci sequence: "))

# Handle small inputs (n = 0 or 1)
if n == 0:
    print("The 0th term in the Fibonacci sequence is 0!")
elif n == 1:
    print("The 1st term in the Fibonacci sequence is 1!")
else:
    # Compute Fibonacci term for n >= 2
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        F_n = second_last + last
        second_last = last
        last = F_n

    print(f"The {n}th term in the Fibonacci sequence is {F_n}.")
```
