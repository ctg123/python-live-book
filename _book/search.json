The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, with each number being the sum of the two before it. The simplest way to generate it in Python is with a loop:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence is a mathematical concept that appears in many areas of science and nature. It is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting with 0 and 1. This pattern forms the basis for applications in fields like computer science and finance.\nTwo main aspects define the Fibonacci sequence: the recursive structure of the sequence and its relationship with the golden ratio.\nRecall that the Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1. Each new number is the sum of the two numbers before it.\nFor example:\n0 + 1 = 1\n1 + 1 = 2\n1 + 2 = 3\n2 + 3 = 5\n3 + 5 = 8\n5 + 8 = 13 …\nMathematically, we write it as F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2). The sequence builds itself by repeatedly adding the last two numbers. The first two numbers, 0 and 1, are the starting point or base cases. Without these, the sequence wouldn’t work.\n\n\n2.11.2 Algorithm refinement\n\nWhen designing algorithms, it is good practice to sketch out the steps in several stages\nThe level of detail increases as you move to the next stage",

Calling the module will by default will generate a random number between 0 and 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe syntax above states that we are calling the random() function from the random module.\n\n3.7.1 randrange\n\nThe randrange() function allows us to generate integers on a specified range\nLet’s generate a number between 1 and 10:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first integer is the lower bound argument and the second integer is the upper bound argument\n\nIt is a Python convention to add a 1 to the upper limit of a range.\n\n\n\n3.7.2 Simulating the roll of two dice\n\nWe can create a function that simulates the outcome of rolling two dice\nThe algorithm is:\n\n(1) Roll dice 1 and store the outcome\n(2) Roll dice 2 and store the outcome\n(3) Add the two outcomes and return to the user\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.7.3 Simulating 10 rolls of two dice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.7.4 Returning multiple outputs via a tuple\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoll two dice and get the outcome of each roll …\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of items in the tuple my_first_roll, my_second_roll must match the number of elements in the function’s output results = (r1,r2)",

    "text": "3.11 Keyword Arguments: Pizza Orders Example\nImagine you’re calling a pizza place, and they ask for a bunch of details like size, crust, toppings, etc. Sometimes you want a specific order, other times you just want the basics. Keyword arguments help us give instructions to our Python functions in a clear way, without worrying about the exact order.\n\n3.11.1 How It Works\nWhen you define a function, you can specify the value where the argument goes. With keyword arguments, instead of just putting a value by its position, you actually say argument_name=value.\nThink of it like this:\n\nPositional: “I want large, thin crust.” (You’re relying on the pizza place knowing ‘large’ is the size and ‘thin crust’ is the type of crust just by the order you say them.)\nKeyword: “I want size=large, crust=thin_crust.” (You’re explicitly telling them which detail is which.)\n\nThe cool part? When you use keywords, you can say them in any order!\nLet’s make a function that “orders” a pizza. We’ll make size and crust required, but toppings and extra cheese can be optional.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Notice how we can put `crust` before `size`, or `extra_cheese` first.\n# Python matches them up because we're using the names!\norder_pizza(extra_cheese=True, toppings=\"olives\", crust=\"stuffed\", size=\"large\")\n\nprint(\"Order 5: Another full custom order, different order of keywords\")\norder_pizza(crust=\"deep-dish\", size=\"small\", extra_cheese=False, toppings=\"sausage\"){pyodide}",
