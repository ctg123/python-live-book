They are a wonderful resource, with the benefit of not requiring you to install any specific distribution of Python, or any specific libraries.\n\nThis is a book created from markdown and executable code.\n\n## Expressions Recap looking at variables\n\n• A line of code generally contains a statement\n\n• Statements indicate the task that we want the computer to perform\n\n::: {#5ee91de3 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nx = 2\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   x is termed an *identifier* of a variable\n\n-   = is the *assignment* symbol\n\n-   2 is an integer that we are assigning to the variable identified by **‘x’**\n\n```{pyodide}\nx = 45\ny = 36\nz = x + y\n```\n\n```{pyodide}\nz\n```\n\n> Note the spaces around operators and the assignment symbol\n\nThis is a recommended programming style for Python: [PEP8 Style Guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)\n\n```{pyodide}\n# this is harder to read\nz=x+y\n\nz\n```\n\n## Variable Names\n\n-   Case-sensitive!\n\n```{pyodide}\nX = 12\nx = 34\nprint(f\"X is {X} and x is {x}\")\nX, x\n```\n\n-   variable names may contain letters, digits, and underscores\n-   cannot begin with a number\n\n```{pyodide}\nxyz_123 = 56\n123_xyz = 56\n```\n\n## Data Types\n\n-   Every variable has a type\n-   Python makes it easy to discover the type of variables with the built-in command type\n\n```{pyodide}\nx = 78\ntype(x)\n```\n\n```{pyodide}\ny = 12.34\ntype(y)\n```\n\ntype is a *function* whose *argument* is y and whose output is float.\n\n## Arithmetic Operations\n\nThe division operator `/` always returns a float, even if the operands are integers. The floor division operator `//` returns the integer part of the division result. The modulus operator `%` gives the remainder after division. Python follows the `PEMDAS` order of operations (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction).\n\n```{pyodide}\n# create two variables\nx = 2\ny = 3\n# Addition\nx + y\n```\n\n```{pyodide}\n# Subtraction\ny - x\n```\n\n```{pyodide}\n# Multplication\nx * y\n```\n\n```{pyodide}\n# Division\ny / x\n```\n\nx raised to the power of y\n```{pyodide}\nx ** y\n```\n\nThe integer floor operation\n```{pyodide}\ny // x\n```\n\nThe modulus (remainder) operation\n```{pyodide}\ny % x\n```\n\n### Operator precedence rules\n\n- Parentheses evaluate first\n– If nested, innermost parentheses evaluate first\n- Exponents evaluate next, in order of right-to-left\n- Multiplication, division, and modulus evaluate next, in order of left-to-right\n- Addition and subtraction evaluate last, in order of left-to-right\n\n```{pyodide}\nx = 30\ny = 5\nz = 25\nx * y + z\n```\n\n```{pyodide}\nx * ( y + z )\n```\n\n### Use parentheses to avoid ambiguity\n\n```{pyodide}\n2 ** 3 ** 4\n```\n\n```{pyodide}\n(2 ** 3) ** 4\n```\n\n```{pyodide}\n2 ** (3 ** 4)\n```\n\n## Strings Intro\n\n- The string type holds sequence of characters\n- The print function displays strings on the screen\n- The `f-string` stands for formatted string literals, a more readable way to include variables\nin strings\n\n```{pyodide}\nx = 'Python is cool'\nprint(x)\n```\n\nStrings can span multiple lines via escape characters\n```{pyodide}\nx = 'Python is lit \\n and is so cool! '\nprint(x)\n```\nBasic f-string example\n```{pyodide}\n# Basic f-string example\nstudent_name = \"Chaance\"\ngrade_level = 9\n\nprint(f\"Welcome {student_name}, you are in grade {grade_level}!\")\n```\n\n```{pyodide}\n# student info examples\ncurrent_semester = \"Summer 2025\"\ncollege_hours = 6\nhigh_school_gpa = 3.5\n\nprint(f\"This {current_semester}, you've earned {college_hours} college credit hours!\")\nprint(f\"Your current GPA is {high_school_gpa}\")\n```\n\n```{pyodide}\n# Compare old string formatting vs f-strings\nstudent = \"John\"\ncredits = 18\n\n# Old way (don't use this)\nprint(\"Student: \" + student + \" has \" + str(credits) + \" credits\")\n# Modern way with f-strings (use this!)\nprint(f\"Student: {student} has {credits} credits\")\n```\n\n```{pyodide}\n# F-strings with formatting options\npercentage = 0.875\nprint(f\"Graduation rate: {percentage:.1%}\") # Shows as 87.5%\ngpa = 3.14159\nprint(f\"GPA: {gpa:.2f}\") # Shows as 3.14\n```\n\n```{pyodide}\n# Multi-line f-strings for reports\nstudent_id = \"123456\"\nname = \"Chaance\"\ntotal_credits = 18\nmax_credits = 26\n# This would print an example report card\nprint(f\"\"\"\n=== GRADE PROGRESS REPORT ===\nStudent Name: {name}\nStudent ID: {student_id}\nTotal Credits Earned: {total_credits}\nCredits Remaining: {max_credits - total_credits}\nCompletion Rate: {(total_credits / max_credits) * 100:.1f}%\n\"\"\")\n```\n\n## Obtaining user input\n- The input function allows the user to supply a value\n- The resulting value is always a string\n\n```python\nname = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\nprint(f\"You entered: {name}\")\n```\n\n> To run the cells in the Jupyterlite environment, you can use `SHIFT + ENTER`.\n\n<iframe\n  src=\"https://jupyterlite.github.io/demo/repl/index.html?kernel=python\"\n  width=\"100%\"\n  height=\"350%\"\n></iframe>\n\nThis code block prompts the user to enter their name and then prints a greeting message.The input function is used to get user input, and the or \"Guest\" part ensures that if the user doesn't enter anything, the default name \"Guest\" is used.\n\n```python\nname = input(\"Enter your name: \") or \"Guest\"\n# The f-string is used to format the greeting message with the user's name.\nprint(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n```\n<iframe\n  src=\"https://jupyterlite.github.io/demo/repl/index.html?kernel=python\"\n  width=\"100%\"\n  height=\"350%\"\n></iframe>\n\n## Casting data types via int\n\n```python\ny = input(\"Please enter your age\")\nz = int(y)\nprint(f\"The variable z is {z}, which is of data type: {type(z)}\")\n```\n<iframe\n  src=\"https://jupyterlite.github.io/demo/repl/index.html?kernel=python\"\n  width=\"100%\"\n  height=\"350%\"\n></iframe>\n\n",
